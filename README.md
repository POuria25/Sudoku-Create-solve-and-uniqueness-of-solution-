# Sudoku-Create-solve-and-uniqueness-of-solution-


Description:

This Sudoku program is a comprehensive tool designed to engage with Sudoku puzzles in various ways. Developed primarily in Python, it offers users the capability to create Sudoku puzzles of different sizes (4x4, 9x9, 16x16, and 25x25), solve existing puzzles, and verify the uniqueness of solutions.

Key Features:

Create Puzzles: Generate Sudoku puzzles of sizes 4x4, 9x9, 16x16, and 25x25, providing users with a diverse set of challenges.

Solve Puzzles: Utilize an efficient SAT solver to find solutions to Sudoku puzzles, providing step-by-step solutions for user-provided puzzles.

Check Uniqueness: Verify the uniqueness of solutions for Sudoku puzzles, ensuring that each puzzle has only one valid solution.

Note: The SAT-solving component, a critical part of this project, has been coded by KATOUZIAN Pouria, enhancing the program's ability to efficiently solve, create, and check the uniqueness of Sudoku solutions. The java core program is provided.

Programming Language:

The program is predominantly implemented in Python, with the SAT-solving component custom-coded by KATOUZIAN Pouria.
